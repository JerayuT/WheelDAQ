Wheel DAQ Design

Wheel Daughter Boards are in charge of all the sensors near or at the wheels of the car. This goal is to make a printed circuit board that is able to interface with all these sensors, and then be able to translate them and send the data over CAN. Each board will have the following components listed below for a total of 4 boards (each wheel).

Components:<br>
- ESP-32 dev-kit C
- Can Transceiver 
- 26-pin connector
- WheelBreak Sensor
- Break Temperature
- Boost Converter
- RR Op-Amp
